## Background to Escape the Woods
Escape the Woods is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) terminal application which is an homage to old-school, text-based adventure games.
Text-based adventure games like [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) were among the first interactive media accessible on computers. Given that they only require user input, they lend themselves perfectly to input validation.
